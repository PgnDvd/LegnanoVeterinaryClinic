# LegnanoVeterinaryClinic <br>
I will model this app for a real veterinary clinic.<br>I had autorization from the owners of LegnavoVet company for use real informations.<br> But i'm not an expert devoleper so use this code carefully.<br> 
I choose a very simple user interface: a logo image<br> a central button bar <br> and some description information.<br>
Used views:<br>
A vertical linear layout that is the external cointainer.<br>
Then into it: an ImageView, an horizontal LinearLayout with four Buttons inside, and two TextView.<br>
As external container of all a scrollView implements landscape mode and visualization for little screen device<br> I do test compatibility with Nexus 5 5.0 1080x1920 xxhdpi <br>
used content description on image view for screen readers and other accessibility tools<br>
